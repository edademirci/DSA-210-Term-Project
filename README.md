DSA 210 Term Project: The Data Behind Smoking Habits
## Introduction & Overview
  This project focuses on possible adverse impacts of smoking on countries, individuals, health and happiness. I will investigate how smoking habits correlate with serious health problems, if smoking has an effect on countries' well-being and expenditures, also some additional concepts by exploring the appropriate data. By implementing data science techniques and visualization i will try to reflect my topic in the most accurate way. This project aims to find informative insights about how smoking patterns influence not only individual health but also societal factors such as happiness and healthcare costs.
## Motivation
 As someone who grew up in a family where no one smokes after harrowing losses in some family members, the topic: "smoking" really gets my attention and I am curious about its general effects. Especially when we started university, my whole entourage slowly started to smoke and try newly e-cigarttes. My personal observations show that my smoker friends' exercising performances (such as running or fitness), immunity, even voices are worse from others. In addition to personal reasons, smoking habits is a truly comprehensive topic which can be investigated in several aspects. For this reason I thought that this would be a suitable topic to see with data visualization and use in my term project.
 ## Data Sources & Collection 
 To perform this project's outcome, I am considering putting together the following publicly available data sources.
 - **Disease Control & Health rate in smokers**
 - **The relationship between cigarette consumption and income/age/education level**
 - **The connection between smoking and BMI(body mass index) and physical activity performance**
 - **Cigarette consumption and health expenditures, air quality and mortality distribution by country**
 - **Trends in recently emerging cigarette types (vape, e- cigartte)**
## Tools & Methods
 #### python
  Main coding language for transfer of data and visualization
 #### visual studio code
  The application I will be using for coding and creating the histograms
 #### pandas
  A library which is very useful in data loading, parsing, merging and comparative analysis 
 #### seaborn/ mathplotlib
  I will benefit for creating bar charts, box plots, heat maps, scatter plots etc.
## Analysis Plan
### 1. Data Cleaning
Cleaning and reorganizing the data and taking the most useful parts for my outcome.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identifying patterns between smoking and health, air quality, education level, age etc.
### 3. Hypothesis testing
By making correlation analysis to see if smoking regularly is really inversely affecting individuals' life quality or countries' death rates.
### 4. Data Visualization
After reaching my final relevant histograms and plots I will present my key findings in the project.
## Expected Outcomes
- Smoking prevalence is expected to be differ among certain demographic groups such as lower income or lower education levels. There may also be observable dissimilarites between genders and age groups in smoking frequency.
- Do smoking habits show a strong negative correlation with key health indicators such as life expectancy, BMI, vital diseas and physical activity levels?
- The analysis may reveal that countries with higher smoking rates might show lower happiness levels, poority in air quality or higher healthcare expenditures.
- What is the general trend in e-cigarettes and smoking habits (inreasing or decreasing)?
